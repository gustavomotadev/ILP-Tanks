# ILP-Tanks
This is an old project of mine from 2017, it is inspired by a classic genre of games in which players shoot bullets or bombs at each other in a randomly generated terrain, attempting to either reduce the enemy health to zero or remove it from said terrain. It was made in C and SDL2 and submitted as a test for a university course.
