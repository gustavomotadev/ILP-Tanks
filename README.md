# ILP-Tanks
This is an old project of mine from 2017, it is inspired by a classic genre of games in which players shoot bullets or bombs at each other in a randomly generated terrain, attempting to either reduce the enemy health to zero or remove it from said terrain. It was made in C and SDL2 and submitted as a test for a university course. This game was heavily inspired by similar Flash games from the 2000s and by the classic "Worms".

# Game Description And Some Technical Details

The game terrain is randomly generated by a custom algorithm that sums many sine functions with different parameters, then introduces more randomness to it using the same algorithm that is used to explode terrain and after that removes small imperfections to smooth it a little bit. The bombs explode the terrain by reducing its height at a specific point and then interpolating this region, using this point and 2 more that are some distance away from it to the left and to the right, the interpolation algorithm used is the cosine interpolation. Above the terrain there is a sky that is purely cosmetic and below it is a lava lake that destroys the tank if it falls there. 

The tanks are able to move as long as they have fuel, that is represented by a yellow bar in the HUD, players start with a full tank and it is consumed when moving but replenishes a half tank each turn. Above the fuel bar, the health bar is displayed, it is green when high, then turns yellow as it decreases and then red as it gets lower, if it reaches zero, the tank is destroyed. Being in the radius of the explosion of a bomb decreases health, doesn't matter if it's an enemy bomb or your own. 

The players are represented by a blue and a red tank, the player that is currently able to take action is highlighted by a floating moving yellow triangle above it. The angle of the player tank is influenced by the terrain it is sitting on, this is calculated using a simple linear regression of the points of the terrain around the tank. Each player can also control the angle of his gun, so that the angle of the shot will be the sum of the tank angle and the gun angle, which means that movement or destruction of terrain can disrupt your aim and so digging your opponent's terrain is a valid strategy. 

Players have different weapons to choose, like 3 simple bombs that vary only in explosion size and the amount of damage; Fire and acid, that both shoot many small particles with the difference being that fire is intended for directly causing damage and acid for terrain destruction; Airstrike, in which you fire a signaling shot that makes 3 bombs fall from the sky wherever it lands. Each player is able to control the strength that will be used to shoot via a white and red gauge that appears when shooting.

The tanks and its parts are polygons, internally represented by sets of points that get 2D transformed by some matrix calculations and then drawn with triangle filling algorithms for the insides and line drawing algorithms for the outline. 

This game is highly experimental in nature, as it was written while I was learning much of the stuff being used, so it is in no way correctly optimized or has the best algorithms or tools being used for each use case. The code is also not so well organized and is composed of only C features with no C++ whatsoever, so no object oriented programming, I was more interested in creating a tech demo and a challenge for myself than writing good code at the time, also I'm more of a game programmer than a game designer.

# Controls

While in the starting screen, press SPACE to regenerate the terrain until you are satisfied with the result, then press ENTER (RETURN) to start the game.

Red player moves and controls gun with WASD, switches weapon with Z and shoots with X.

Blue player moves and controls gun with arrow keys, switches weapon with RCTRL and shoots with RSHIFT.

After the game ends, it can be restarted by pressing ENTER (RETURN).
